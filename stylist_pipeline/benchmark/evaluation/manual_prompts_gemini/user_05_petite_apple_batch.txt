SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a professional fashion stylist with 20 years of experience working with women of all body types, sizes, and styling goals. You understand how fabric weight, silhouette, neckline shape, hemline length, color value, and pattern interact with different body proportions to create visual effects.

You are evaluating an AI styling recommendation engine. For each test case, you will see:
1. A garment description (and optionally an image)
2. A woman's body profile (measurements, shape, height, goals)
3. The AI engine's recommendation (score, verdict, reasoning)

Your job is to evaluate whether the AI's recommendation would serve this woman well. Be critical. Look for:
- Verdicts that would lead to bad purchases (TII for a garment that will look terrible)
- Verdicts that would cause missed opportunities (NTO for a garment that would actually work)
- Reasoning that identifies the wrong strengths or weaknesses
- Missing issues the engine didn't catch (e.g., fabric cling risk, hemline in danger zone)
- Body-unsafe language or assumptions

Respond ONLY with the JSON evaluation object. No preamble, no explanation outside the JSON.

USER: Petite Apple — compound challenge: needs height AND midsection management

GARMENT:
A thin champagne satin slip dress with spaghetti straps and bias cut. The fabric is lightweight satin (Polyester 100%) at around 110 GSM — it will cling to every curve and gather in the midsection. Very drapey with moderate sheen. No structure, no waist definition. The light champagne color reflects light and visually expands. This is the worst-case garment for anyone with midsection concerns — the thin satin maps the body faithfully.

Attributes: Type: dress, Silhouette: column, Fabric: polyester, Weight: very_light, Neckline: v_neck, Hemline: midi, Color: champagne (light), Pattern: solid, Fit: fitted, Waist: undefined

WOMAN'S BODY PROFILE:
- Height: 5'1"

- Key measurements: Bust 38.0", Waist 35.0", Hip 37.0"
- Size category: standard
- Her styling goals: wants to appear taller; wants to conceal her midsection

AI ENGINE RECOMMENDATION:
- Score: 4/10
- Verdict: Not This One
- Headline: "The fabric makes this a no — here's what to search for."
- Reasoning: "At this length, you get maximum leg elongation. But the fabric doesn't have enough weight to smooth through the midsection. Search for a sculpting dress in ponte or structured knit — thick enough to shape, not cling."

GARMENT:
A fitted black ponte sheath dress with V-neckline, hitting just below the knee. Medium-weight double-knit ponte (Polyester 95%, Elastane 5%) with good structure and no sheen. Sleeveless with defined waist from princess seaming. Solid black. The structured fabric holds its shape and won't cling — creates a clean column effect. The dark color produces a continuous vertical line. This is the universal crowd-pleaser that should work for most body types.

GARMENT:
An oversized tent-shaped dress in oatmeal heavy linen. Crew neckline, dropped shoulders, no waist definition at all. The fabric is thick (280+ GSM), stiff linen that stands away from the body. Falls to below-knee length in a trapeze shape. Completely conceals the midsection and hips, but also hides any waist definition — will look boxy on hourglass figures. Good for apple bodies wanting concealment, bad for rectangles wanting curves.

Attributes: Type: dress, Silhouette: tent, Fabric: linen, Weight: heavy, Neckline: crew_neck, Hemline: below_knee, Color: oatmeal (light), Pattern: solid, Fit: oversized, Waist: undefined

GARMENT:
A fitted crew-neck top in navy and white horizontal stripes. Thin cotton-modal jersey (160 GSM) with 5% elastane for stretch. The horizontal stripes are medium-width (about 1 inch) with high contrast between navy and white. Hits at high hip. The combination of horizontal lines + clinging fabric + high contrast is the classic widening combination — this should penalize heavily for wider midsections and apple shapes.

Attributes: Type: top, Silhouette: sheath, Fabric: cotton + elastane, Weight: light, Neckline: crew_neck, Color: navy and white (medium), Pattern: stripes_horizontal, Fit: fitted, Waist: undefined

GARMENT:
High-rise wide-leg trousers in dark navy. Structured cotton-blend fabric (Cotton 70%, Polyester 28%, Elastane 2%) at medium-heavy weight. Sits at natural waist with a defined waistband, front pleats, and full-length wide legs. The high rise elongates the leg line. Dark solid color with matte finish. No pattern. These are the go-to elongation pants — the high waist + wide leg + dark color creates maximum vertical line. Should score very well for petite women wanting to look taller.

Attributes: Type: pants, Silhouette: column, Fabric: cotton + polyester, Weight: medium, Hemline: floor_length, Color: navy (dark), Pattern: solid, Fit: relaxed, Waist: defined

WOMAN'S BODY PROFILE:

GARMENT:
A fitted crop top in white thin jersey. Scoop neckline, cap sleeves. The fabric is lightweight cotton-spandex jersey (150 GSM, Cotton 92%, Spandex 8%) that clings and maps the body. Hits at natural waist, exposing the midsection. White color reflects light and makes areas appear larger. This is a multi-risk garment for apple and plus-size bodies: the crop exposes the midsection, the thin clinging fabric maps bumps, and the white color expands visually.

Attributes: Type: top, Silhouette: bodycon, Fabric: cotton + spandex, Weight: light, Neckline: scoop_neck, Color: white (very_light), Pattern: solid, Fit: tight, Waist: undefined

GARMENT:
A dark navy A-line midi dress with defined waist. V-neckline, three-quarter sleeves. Made from medium-weight crepe (Polyester 97%, Elastane 3%) with subtle structure — skims rather than clings. Fitted bodice with seam-defined waist, then flares gently from the hip to midi length. Dark solid color with matte finish. This is the universal crowd-pleaser: the V-neck elongates, the defined waist creates shape, the A-line accommodates wider hips, the dark color slims, and the midi hem is safe for most heights. Should score 7+ for nearly everyone.

Attributes: Type: dress, Silhouette: fit_and_flare, Fabric: polyester + elastane, Weight: medium, Neckline: v_neck, Hemline: midi, Color: navy (dark), Pattern: solid, Fit: semi_fitted, Waist: defined

GARMENT:
A bodycon mini dress in light pink thin jersey. Round neckline, sleeveless. Extremely thin cotton-polyester jersey (130 GSM, Polyester 65%, Cotton 30%, Elastane 5%) that clings tightly to every contour. Hits mid-thigh. Light pink color amplifies body volume. No structure, no shaping seams. This is the maximum adversarial garment — the bodycon fit maps every bump, the thin jersey provides zero structure, the mini length exposes the widest part of the thigh, and the light pink color expands visually. Should score very low for apple and pear bodies.

GARMENT:
A floor-length maxi dress in a colorful floral chiffon print. V-neckline with flutter sleeves. The fabric is lightweight chiffon (Polyester 100%) — sheer, floaty, with a lined bodice and unlined skirt. Large-scale floral pattern in warm tones (coral, green, cream) on a dark base. The sheer fabric layers and moves beautifully, but the extreme length will overwhelm petite frames. The large floral print can also visually expand. At floor-length on a 4'11" woman, this creates a fabric-to-person ratio that drowns the wearer.

Attributes: Type: dress, Silhouette: a_line, Fabric: polyester, Weight: very_light, Neckline: v_neck, Hemline: floor_length, Color: multicolor floral (medium), Pattern: floral_large, Fit: relaxed, Waist: semi_defined

GARMENT:
A structured single-breasted blazer in charcoal grey. Notch lapels, two-button closure, hits at the hip. Made from medium-weight suiting fabric (Polyester 65%, Viscose 30%, Elastane 5%) with a structured drape — holds its shape, creates clean lines. Fully lined. The hip-length hem covers the widest part of the hips and creates a smooth line through the torso. The structured shoulders balance wider hips (good for pear shapes). Charcoal grey is slimming without being as stark as black. This is the classic balancing layer piece.
