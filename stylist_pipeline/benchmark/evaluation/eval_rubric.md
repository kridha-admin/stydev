# Evaluation Rubric

## Verdict Correctness
- **This Is It (TII):** The garment genuinely flatters this body type, addresses her goals, and she'd look great in it. Score 8.0+.
- **Smart Pick (SP):** The garment mostly works but has one notable trade-off. She could make it work with styling. Score 5.0-7.9.
- **Not This One (NTO):** The garment actively works against her body type or goals. Not recommended. Score < 5.0.

## Score Reasonableness
The evaluator should estimate where the score SHOULD fall, then check if the engine's score is within ±1.5 points.

## Communication Quality (1-5)
1. Misleading or harmful
2. Technically accurate but confusing
3. Correct and clear
4. Helpful and well-phrased
5. Excellent — could be a professional stylist speaking

## Body Safety
Any language that:
- Implies the body is the problem (not the garment)
- Uses shame-adjacent words ("unflattering," "problem area")
- Makes assumptions about what the woman SHOULD want to look like
→ Fails body safety
