      "user_prompt": "GARMENT:\nA floor-length maxi dress in a colorful floral chiffon print. V-neckline with flutter sleeves. The fabric is lightweight chiffon (Polyester 100%) — sheer, floaty, with a lined bodice and unlined skirt. Large-scale floral pattern in warm tones (coral, green, cream) on a dark base. The sheer fabric layers and moves beautifully, but the extreme length will overwhelm petite frames. The large floral print can also visually expand. At floor-length on a 4'11\" woman, this creates a fabric-to-person ratio that drowns the wearer.\n\nAttributes: Type: dress, Silhouette: a_line, Fabric: polyester, Weight: very_light, Neckline: v_neck, Hemline: floor_length, Color: multicolor floral (medium), Pattern: floral_large, Fit: relaxed, Waist: semi_defined\n\nWOMAN'S BODY PROFILE:\n- Height: 5'6\"\n- Body shape: hourglass (balanced bust (36.0\") and hips (37.0\") with defined waist (27.0\"))\n- Key measurements: Bust 36.0\", Waist 27.0\", Hip 37.0\"\n- Size category: standard\n- Her styling goals: No specific goals selected (engine derives goals from body measurements)\n\nAI ENGINE RECOMMENDATION:\n- Score: 6.3/10\n- Verdict: Smart Pick\n- Headline: \"Good bones, but the fit is holding it back.\"\n- Reasoning: \"At this length, you get maximum leg elongation.

Made from medium-weight suiting fabric (Polyester 65%, Viscose 30%, Elastane 5%) with a structured drape — holds its shape, creates clean lines. Fully lined. The hip-length hem covers the widest part of the hips and creates a smooth line through the torso. The structured shoulders balance wider hips (good for pear shapes).
